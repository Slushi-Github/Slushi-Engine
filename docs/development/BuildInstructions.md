# How to build Slushi Engine:

## Windows:

1. Install [Haxe](https://haxe.org/)
2. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
3. Clone the repository, create a folder for it, and navigate to it, then run the following command: ```git clone https://github.com/Slushi-Github/Slushi-Engine.git```

Set up [Visual Studio](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_BuildTools.exe) dependencies:

select "Individual Components" and make sure to download the following: 

    - MSVC v143 VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 
    - Windows 10/11 SDK

Set up Haxe libs of the engine:

**In the latest version, get the ``.haxelib`` folder from the releases page, unzip that file and just skip to the compilation step.**

In you project folder first run the following commands: 

    haxelib install hmm
    haxelib run hmm setup
    hmm install

Set up Hxcpp: 

(This step is optional, the official Hxcpp library should already be installed by default when you did the previous step)

SLE uses its own Hxcpp library. First, install Hxcpp from git, with the following command:

    haxelib git hxcpp https://github.com/Slushi-Github/SLE-hxcpp

Then, navigate to the Hxcpp folder (``yourProject/.haxelib/hxcpp/git/tools/hxcpp/``) and run the following command: 

    haxe compile.hxml

If you try to compile after skiping this step, the compiler will mention this step and give you the option to automatically execute that command.

Setup Lime with the following command: ``haxelib run lime setup``

Build the engine with the following command: ``lime test windows``

## Linux:
1. Install Haxe, read the [Haxe installation guide for Linux](https://haxe.org/download/linux/) and follow the steps
2. Install Git (they are already installed by default on Linux distros usually)
3. Clone the repository, create a folder for it, and navigate to it, then run the following command: ```git clone https://github.com/Slushi-Github/Slushi-Engine.git```
